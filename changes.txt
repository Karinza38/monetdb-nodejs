- q is now always included

- environment is not automatically added, but a shortcut function exists to retrieve it

- mocha testcases

- No more exposure of system vars

TESTCASES
- Test passing in options
- Fetching environment
- Failing connection (reconnect)
- Failing connection in between prepared statement and exec fn
- Delayed connect (ie putting queries in the queue before calling connect)


NOTES:
- releasefun of MonetDBConnection.prepare does not return a promise, hence completion can not be checked
- null values in query result are now represented by javascript null instead of undefined,
since null could never be the result of an actual value.
