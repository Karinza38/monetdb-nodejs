## Query result size
Query result size can be set with `replySize` `Connection` option. It defines the number of data rows returned in the initial response.
By default this options is set to `-1`, which means fetch all the data. If `replySize` is set to any positive number, only that many
data rows will be fetched, while the rest will stay cached at the server. The `replySize` can be set initially when connection is created, or by invoking `setReplySize` method on the `Connection` object.
```ts
// set replySize to 100
const conn = new Connection({database: 'test', replySize: 100});
await conn.connect();
let res = await conn.execute("select * from generate_series(1, 1001)");
console.log(res.data.length);
// 100
await conn.setReplySize(-1); // back to default
res = await conn.execute("select * from generate_series(1, 1001)");
console.log(res.data.length);
// 1000
```
## Streaming query result
When query result is quite large it's often useful to start process the data chunks as soon as they are available
on the client. This can be achieved by invoking `execute` method on the `Connection` object with `stream=true`.
```ts
//  execute(sql: string, stream?: boolean): Promise<any>;
const ready = await conn.connect();
const stream: QueryStream = await conn.execute('select * from generate_series(1, 10000)', true);
const colInfo = [];
const data = [];
stream.on('header', (cols: any[]) => {
    // do something with col info
});

stream.on('data', (tuples: any[]) => {
    for (let t of tuples) {
        data.push(t);
    }
});

stream.on('end', () => {
  // do something on end of streaming
});

await conn.close();
```
