## Query result size
Query result size can be set with the `Connection` option `replySize`. It defines the number of data rows returned in the initial response.
By default, this option is set to `-1`, which means fetching all the data. If `replySize` is set to a positive number, only that many
data rows will be fetched, while the rest will stay cached at the server. The `replySize` can be set when connection is created or by invoking the `setReplySize` method on the `Connection` object.
```ts
// set replySize to 100
const conn = new Connection({database: 'test', replySize: 100});
await conn.connect();
let res = await conn.execute("select * from generate_series(1, 1001)");
console.log(res.data.length);
// 100
await conn.setReplySize(-1); // back to default
res = await conn.execute("select * from generate_series(1, 1001)");
console.log(res.data.length);
// 1000
```
## Streaming query result
When the query result is large, it's often useful to start processing the data chunks as soon as they are available
on the client. This can be achieved by invoking the `execute` method on the `Connection` object with `stream=true`.
```ts
import { Connection } from 'monetdb'

const conn = new Connection({database: 'test'})
const ready = await conn.connect();
const stream = await conn.execute('select * from generate_series(1, 10000)', true);
const colInfo = [];
const data = [];
stream.on('header', (cols) => {
    console.log(cols);
});

stream.on('data', (tuples) => {
    for (let t of tuples) {
        data.push(t);
    }
});

stream.on('end', () => {
    console.log(data);
    console.log('THE END')
    conn.close();
});
```
