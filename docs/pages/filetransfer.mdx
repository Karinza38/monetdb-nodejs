## File Transfer
MonetDB supports the non-standard `COPY INTO` statement to load a CSV-like
text file into a table or to dump a table into a text file. This statement has an
optional modifier `ON CLIENT` to indicate that the server should not
try to open the file on the server side but instead ask the client to open it
on its behalf.

For example::
```sql
	COPY INTO mytable FROM 'data.csv' ON CLIENT
	USING DELIMITERS ',', E'\n', '"';
```
For security reasons, `monetdb-nodejs` enforces files to be relative to the current
working directory of the Node.js process.
## Skip rows and early cancellation
MonetDB's `COPY INTO` statement allows you to skip, for example, the first
line in a file using the modifier `OFFSET 2` and load `n` records from the file using
the `RECORDS` modifier.
```sql
	COPY 100 RECORDS OFFSET 2 INTO mytable FROM 'data.csv' ON CLIENT
```
For detailed documentation on `COPY INTO` statement, please vist [MonetDB documentation on data import and export](https://www.monetdb.org/documentation-Jun2023/user-guide/sql-manual/data-loading/).
## Examples
### Upload data from file
Assume `data.csv` with the following content:
```bash
cat<<EOF>data.csv
1|one
2|two
3|three
EOF
```
One can upload this file into MonetDB using:
```ts
import {Connection} from 'monetdb';

const conn = new Connection({database: 'test'});
const ready = await conn.connect();
await conn.execute('create table foo(i int, a varchar(10))');
let res = await conn.execute(`copy into foo from \'data.csv\' on client`);
res = await conn.execute('select * from foo order by i');
console.log(res.data);
// [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two'], [3, 'three']]
```
### Download data to file
```ts
// Download
const ready = await conn.connect();
let res = await conn.execute('copy (select * from sys.generate_series(1,1001)) into \'foo.csv\' on client');
console.log(res.affectedRows);
// 1000
```
